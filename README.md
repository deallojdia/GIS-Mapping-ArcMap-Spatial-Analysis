# GIS-Mapping-ArcMap-Spatial-Analysis
Academic Project at University
Description:
This project visualizes agricultural and forest land areas by county in Albania using data from the Agricultural Census (INSTAT). The data is processed in ArcGIS/ArcMap to create thematic maps showing land distribution and usage.

Technologies Used:
ArcGIS / ArcMap – GIS software for mapping and spatial analysis
Shapefiles (.shp) – geographic data format
Excel / CSV – statistical data from INSTAT

Main Features:
Import and merge county shapefiles with statistical data
Create thematic maps: Graduated Colors, Dot Density, Pie Charts
Add map elements: legend, title, north arrow, scale bar
Export maps to PDF for presentation

What I Learned:
How to build thematic maps and visualize spatial data
Linking shapefiles with databases to display attribute data
Using map visualization techniques for clearer data presentation
Importance of map elements for readability and interpretation
Exporting and saving GIS projects for further use
